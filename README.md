# CoM-Admission-Standard
A dynamic program allowing one to determine when they meet the City of Mississauga Swim Admission standards (to be used in the near future)
  The City of Mississauga Admission Standard program determines whether or not a group of patrons are eligible to attend a recreational swim, based off of supervision guidelines determined by the swim standards.
      The program is looking to be implemented into the system in 2019 for public use.
